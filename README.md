# 5Beam-Turbulence-Methods

A set of codes to process turbulence data from a 5-beam Accoustic Doppler Current Profiler (specifically the Nortek Signature 1000 AD2CP).


Scripts are provided for:
1. The estimation of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate from TKE frequency spectra and structure function
2. The estimation of Reynolds stressses using all 5 beam information and tilt corrections 
and for the estimation of turbulent kinetic energy shear production using the Reynolds stresses. 
Plots to analyze TKE budget along the water column.
