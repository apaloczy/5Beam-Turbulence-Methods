# 5Beam-Turbulence-Methods

A set of codes to process turbulence data from a 5-beam Accoustic Doppler Current Profiler (specifically the Nortek Signature 1000 AD2CP).


The following turbulence parameters can be estimated using this scripts and functions:

1. Turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate from TKE frequency spectra and structure function
2. Reynolds stressses using all 5 beam information and tilt corrections 
3. Turbulent kinetic energy vertical shear production 

Plotting functions are also included.

The 5beamMethods_Document.pdf file contains a detailed explanation of each of the scripts and functions.

The following working directory is recomended to use this scripts:
